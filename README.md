# UPI Payment System üí∏

A simulated UPI (Unified Payments Interface) banking system built with **Python**, leveraging **FastAPI**, **SQLite**, and **socket programming**. It replicates core functionality of UPI transactions between **Users**, **Merchants**, and **Banks** across a shared LAN.

## üß± Architecture

This project consists of **3 key components**:

1. **Bank Server (`bank.py`)**  
   Hosts all banks and handles user/merchant registrations, validations, and balance updates.

2. **UPI Machine (`upi_machine.py`)**  
   Acts as the central node for merchant registration and QR/VMID-based transaction initiation.

3. **User Client (`user_client.py`)**  
   Used by customers to register and perform UPI transactions using MMID and VMID.

## üß™ Features

### ‚úÖ User
- Register with a bank branch using name, IFSC, mobile, password, and UPI PIN.
- Receive a **UID** and **MMID** (generated via SHA256).
- Perform transactions using Merchant VMIDs.

### ‚úÖ Merchant
- Register via the UPI Machine with name, IFSC, and password.
- Receive a **MID** (Merchant ID) ‚Äî 16-digit hexadecimal string.
- Generate a **VMID** by encrypting the MID using the **SPECK cipher**.
- VMID is encoded in a QR Code for transaction initiation.

### ‚úÖ Transaction
- User provides MMID, PIN, and Merchant VMID.
- UPI Machine forwards the transaction to the appropriate Bank Server.
- If verified, funds are transferred from User to Merchant.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup

- Python 3.8+
- Install required packages: qrcode , pillow

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Bank Server

Run the following command:

```bash
python bank.py
```

This will launch the Bank Server which supports multiple banks like HDFC, SBI, and ICICI.


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Register a Merchant (via UPI Machine)

Run the following command:

```bash
python upi_machine.py
```

Choose option `1`:

```plaintext
1. Register a Merchant
2. Generate QR Code for UPI Transactions
```

After registration, choose option `2` and enter your MID to generate a VMID and QR code for transactions.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Register and Transact as User

Run the following command:

```bash
python user_client.py
```

Choose:

1. To register as a user.  
2. To initiate a transaction:

- Enter your MMID.
- UPI PIN.
- Merchant‚Äôs VMID (from QR).
- Amount to pay.

If successful, you‚Äôll see the response from the bank.

## üí° Notes

- All sockets run over LAN (use private IPs like `192.168.x.x` or `172.x.x.x`).
- Ensure firewalls allow connections to ports `8000` and `9001`.
- Each entity (user, merchant) is linked to a specific bank via IFSC code.
